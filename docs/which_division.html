 <div>Both snippets feature a division operator spelled `/`.

In the Python snippet, in the first `print` it operates on two integers and the result is a float, and in the second `print` it operates on two floats and the result is a float. The `/` operator is true division both given integers and given floats.

In the Rust snippet, in the first `print` it operates on two integers and the result is an integer, and in the second `print` it operates on two floats and the result is a float. The `/` operator is truncated division given integers and true division given floats.

This way of putting things seems adequate to me in practice, but also misleading. It makes it sound as though in Python `/` is univocal (true division in both occurrences) but in Rust `/` is equivocal (truncated division in the first occurrence, true division in the second, the meaning determined by its operands' types). It makes it sound as though `/` in Rust may be approximate or exact. It makes it sound as though arithmetic operators in programming languages operate on numbers.

In fact, surely `/` is univocal in Rust as well as Python, it's ill-posed to ask whether the operation is approximate or exact, and the arithmetic operators operate on typed values.

So how should we put things then, short of reciting Python and Rust's implementations?

Perhaps something like: "You know the mapping between the typed values the operators operate on and the numbers you learned about in school. In Python, `/` works like this: map its operands to school numbers, divide the school numbers, and map the result back to a float. (Thus: Python's `1` and `2` map to one and two, dividing which gives a half, and mapping back to a float gives `0.5`. Ditto for `1.0` and `2.0`.) In Rust, `/` works like this: map its operands to school numbers, divide the school numbers, and truncate the result as necessary so that what it maps back to is the same type as the operands. (Thus: Rust's `1` and `2` map to one and two, dividing which gives a half, which has to be truncated to zero to map back to an integer, namely `0`. Ditto for `1.0` and `2.0`, except no truncation is needed: you can map a half itself back to `0.5`.)"

A mouthful, sure, but clearer I think.
